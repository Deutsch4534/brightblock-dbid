## Purpose

http://dbid.io "dBid" is a peer to peer decentralised marketplace and auction site built on using Blockstack with payments and
provenance of assets on Bitcoin and Lightning.

![Turn unused stuff into Bitcoin!](http://dbid.io/static/banner.png "Turn unused stuff into Bitcoin")

Our goals include promoting every day use of bitcoin - not just trading and hoarding it! To this end we are prioritising payments via bitcoin and lightning right now.

Our background includes ten years in auction software inspiring us, through getting involved with blockstack and bitcoin, to build a trading platform free from the usual pitfalls of e-commerce on the conventional net. To this end we are working towards a bidding engine that is far more resistant to practices such as shill and back office bidding and that places privacy of user data at the heart of its operations.

Another touchpoint, where decentralised technology brings new benefits to e-commerce, is in the shipping and reconciliation process. By using programmable money we can do much better than the conventional internet for example by holding funds in escrow while shipping completes: something that is especially important in the exchange of second hand goods.

Finally I'd just like to say we are a small team working on this project because we see the benefits of decentralisation and the change of ethos that this entails - for this reason your support is especially welcome!
